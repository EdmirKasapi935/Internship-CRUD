# Internchip-C#-CRUD
This is a CRUD project which I worked on during an internship. The aim was to learn how to build an application with basic features. I chose to create something similar to AirBnB(in topic).<br/>
In order to run this project, you need:<br/>
-Visual Studio, with ASP.NET pachages/components installed.<br/>
-SQL Server Studio.<br/>
Import the project's database in SQl server studio and make sure to change the server name and database name of the connection string(found in appsettings.json) accordingly. Below, are the packages used for this project.<br/>
